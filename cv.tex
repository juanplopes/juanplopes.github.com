\section{What I do?}

	I love code in all its forms. Love writing and love reading. I'm a programmer since I was 9, when discovered that QBasic used to come with Windows 95. 
	
	As a good programmer, I like participating in programming contests. I attended to the last five editions of \textbf{ICPC} (2007 to 2011), being south-american finalist in four of them.
	
	Nowadays I write programs professionally. Some companies say I am a MCTS and PSD. Not that I care about those titles, but some people seem to like it. Personally, I value much more writing actual code than any title.
	
	I participate in \textbf{Coding Dojos} with regular frequency. It is a great oportunity to try new languages, new problems and talk to great programmers.
	
	I am also an eventual writer for .Net Magazine (a brazilian publication about Microsoft technologies). It's a mainstream publication, but I like to write about the \textbf{ALT.NET} side of the .Net technologies.
	
	Last, but not least, you can see most of the recent codes I wrote at my github (\textbf{github.com/juanplopes}). Actually, it says more about me than any of these words.
	
\section{Where did I work?}

	My current position is at \textbf{Intelie}, a company focused in building tools for operation intelligence. I am now writing \textbf{Java} code more than usual, actually liking it. It's a good company to practice writing code that analyzes lots of data. Learning to improve code performance is a must there. I am now a big fan of JVM because of this experience. I am working there since \textbf{August 2011}.
	
	Before that, I worked at \textbf{Living Consultoria}. Worked there from \textbf{December 2007 to July 2011}. I was a \textbf{lead developer} playing as architect. The focus of the company are .Net Technologies, so I spent most of my time writing \textbf{C\#}, but I've worked with \textbf{Ruby} (on and off Rails) and some \textbf{PHP} too. 
	
	There, I developed a framework (\textbf{github.com/juanplopes/simple}) that is used in almost every project in the company. Today I'm not a \emph{framework guy} anymore, but it was a good experience creating it. 
	
	I played a major role implementing the first projects using \textbf{Scrum} in the company; participated in some \textbf{international projects}, collaborating with teams from many countries. Traveled to \textbf{Amsterdam} a couple of times, because of this.
	
	Worked also 9 months at \textbf{Biologica Sistemas}. Was a great experience developing \textbf{biometric systems}. There was lots of Java and \textbf{C++}, but also a little C\#. Most of the customers were public companies. It was a good lab to improve my \textbf{math skills}. There, I met most of the people who motivated me into competing at ICPC.

\section{Where did I study?}

	I have studied at \textbf{UERJ} (en: \emph{Rio de Janeiro State University}) since 2006. It is one of the largest Brazilian universities. I have already completed all the regular course, but still trying to acquire the degree of \textbf{Bachelor in Computer Science}. Writing the monograph. Some say it's only an excuse to still compete at ICPC. But it's obviously gossip.

\section{How to find me?}

	As a true geek, I like smartphones. Android, mostly. So I will almost always have my phone with me, You can call me at \textbf{(+55 21) 9317 4772}.
	
	I also have an email account. Itâ€™s probably the best way to find me. You can mail me at \textbf{me@juanlopes.net}.
